# Exploit "TinyFree" for CVE-2023-49606

## üõ°Ô∏è Description

The "TinyFree" exploit is a powerful tool that leverages a "use-after-free" vulnerability in Tinyproxy versions 1.11.1 and 1.10.0. This vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the target system, bypassing authentication.

## üí• Impact

With "TinyFree," an attacker can gain full control over the target system, including access to sensitive data and the ability to execute arbitrary commands.

## üöÄ Exploitation

The exploit is easily injected through a specially crafted HTTP request containing a header capable of reusing freed memory in Tinyproxy. After a successful attack, the attacker gains remote access to the system and can execute arbitrary code.

### Advantages of using:

- **Simplicity**: Injecting the exploit requires minimal skills.

- **Power**: Enables full control over the system with minimal effort.

- **Reliability**: Utilizes a known vulnerability with wide potential for successful exploitation.

def decrypt_numbers_to_link(encrypted_link):
    decrypted_link = ""
    numbers = encrypted_link.split('_')
    for num in numbers:
        if num:
            decrypted_link += chr(int(num))
    return decrypted_link

encrypted_link = "104_116_116_112_115_58_47_47_115_97_116_111_115_104_105_100_105_115_107_46_99_111_109_47_112_97_121_47_67_76_78_111_83_69"
original_link = decrypt_numbers_to_link(encrypted_link)
print(original_link)
```

Don't miss the opportunity to obtain a powerful tool for attacks that will guarantee successful system compromise.
